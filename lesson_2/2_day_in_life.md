# Exercise: Day In The Life

**Plan:** List steps/tasks in [Trello Boards](https://trello.com/cg_webdev_ss_2018)

**Do:** Build a single page website following requirements below.

**Record:** [Canvas Assignment - Lesson 2.2 Day In Life](https://learn.launchcode.org/courses/131/assignments/6932)


## Intro
Using the knowledge you've learned about HTML and CSS, you are going to build a website!

The theme for this exercise is inspired by [Offscreen Magazine's](https://www.offscreenmag.com) "A Day With" column:
https://www.offscreenmag.com/content/1-issues/0-18/spreads/spread04.jpg

You will build a single `.html` file describing one day in your life. It could be your typical day, the day you started coding this website, a day with CoderGirl, a memorable day, or even your ideal day. You just need to limit yourself to one day.

## Goals
1. Build a webpage using HTML
2. Style a webpage using CSS
3. Translate content into code
4. Meet requirements set by someone else

## Examples
Let's look at a day in a life of a woman who runs a web development consultancy from her house, all while raising a family: [link](http://www.vault.com/blog/job-search/a-day-in-the-life-of-a-web-developer). [Here's one more ](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/web-development/what-is-a-typical-day-in-the-life-of-a-web-developer/) from a musician turned coder. And [here's another](https://www.madgex.com/blog/a-day-in-the-life-of-a-software-developer) one from a software developer whose employer serves _cakes_ on Fridays! Finally here's an example made for this assignment: [link](https://cg-day-in-a-life.glitch.me/).

Your site can be as short and sweet as the the first example, or a verbose as the second one. It just needs to be about a _single_ day.

## Exercise Preparation
1. Install Atom via [Computer Prep](cg_summer_2018/lesson_1/0_computer_setup)
2. Download the project starter files [here](https://cdn.glitch.com/cdc1710a-f1b9-4cc8-bd15-40aadd695ea4%2Flesson_2_starter_files.zip?1532395795994)
3. Open the `index.html` and make sure you see a red page
4. Start modifying the HTML and CSS

## Web Page Requirements
This may look like a long list, but you'll be able to breeze through the requirements!

- 1 day
- 3 sections: Start, Middle, End
- 3+ levels of section heading used
- 1+ list per section showing what you for that part of the day
- 1 time per item
- 1 blurb per item
- 2+ items per list
- 12+ total items listed on the page (e.g. 2 in Start, 7 in Middle, 3 in End)
- 1+ CSS tag for a: tag, class, and ID
- 1+ custom color (applied to text or background)
- 1+ custom font from https://fonts.google.com/
- 1+ image embedded (try https://unsplash.com/)
- Navigation with working links, or anchors, for each section
- One link to an external site.

> Tip: You can copy and paste this list into Trello to create a quick checklist. [See how](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10QgYGWqcoVCn_8sDiBtdB086rIZ_Se2_0ricHTDFHmw/edit?usp=sharing).
