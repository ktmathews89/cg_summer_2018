# HTML CSS Basics

Time to learn some code! First up, HTML CSS. HTML is used to structure the content of a web page. CSS is used to style that content.

**Plan: [Trello Boards](https://trello.com/cg_webdev_ss_2018)**

**Do: _see learning content below_**

**Record: [Canvas Assignment - Lesson 2.1 HTML/CSS Basics](https://learn.launchcode.org/courses/131/assignments/6831)**


#### Take Course: Udacity HTML and CSS syntax

We will be taking a couple of class at Udacity. So make sure when you create a user account you record that username and password some where. Complete the Udacity HTML/CSS content.

_note: this link might redirect you if you have not created an account yet. So create and an account and then either click on the link again or find the course on Udacity._


#### Practice: SoloLearn HTML and CSS Challenges

We will probably be using SoloLearn through out the semester. So again, make sure when you create a user account you record your username and password somewhere.

SoloLearn is more challenge based... less instruction based. So hopefully you will fly through these challenges after the Udacity course. One note though, there is "Try It Yourself" button in some of the SoloLearn content, that will open their example code in a new tab for you to play with. **I highly recommend you using the "Try It Yourself" button to play around with the code.** Soon you will be creating everything yourself so practice with something that is already written is beneficial.
