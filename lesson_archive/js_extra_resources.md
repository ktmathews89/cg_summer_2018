# Javascript Extra Resources

This is a list of extra Javascript resources to use on your JS journey. You each how you like but I will provide suggestions next to each resource.

The goal is to get your comfortable with completing the second Javascript CG Education challenge.


#### Learn Javascript Simple Guide/Reference

find here: [https://www.javascript.com/learn/](https://www.javascript.com/learn/)

**Description:**

I would read through this resources one time. And then refer to it when I'm trying to complete the 2nd Javascript challenge.

**Suggested Use:**

#### Mozilla Javascript Guide

find here: [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide)

**Description:**

This is Mozilla's javascript guide. It has key javascript concepts laid out in sections. Some of the concepts we won't get to until later (or at all) bc they are very advanced but it also discusses the intro concepts as well :) They have examples written out (kind of like I did on the board in class) and talk through what the example code is doing (kind of like I did in class).

**Suggested Use:**

I Then I would use this for reference. If you find yourself confused when trying to write javascript or getting a lot of errors, it would be good to go view that section in this guide. So if your function keep printing errors to your console, I would go to this reference and read through the function section.


#### Udacity Javascript Course

find here: [https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud803](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud803)

**Description:**

This is Udacity's Intro to Javascript Course. They have sections for Data Types and Variables, Conditionals, Loops, Functions, Arrays, and Objects.

**Suggested Use:**

So I know Udacity isn't the best for somethings, however... I think sometimes after doing something like free code camp where you do a lot of "doing" and not a lot of "why are you doing that" ... it might be good to hear someone talk through the Javascript concepts. So listening to a couple of the 3 mins video might go a long way. Of course you can skip around and if you don't think one part is helpful just move on.


#### Javscript.info Read Through Tutorial

**Description:**

So these course dive deep into javascript. A little too deep for an intro, but the start basic and get more elaborate as you scroll down the page. One thing to note... some of the syntax will be a little different than you are used to because they are using the new javascript tools. Like for example, they use `let` instead of 'var'. For now, it is the same thing. `let` is just the newer javascript version of `var`.

**Suggested Use:**

I would browse through at least one section listed below. If you think it was helpful then browse through more, but if it is not your thing... that is okay too!

[Variables](https://javascript.info/variables)

[Arrays](https://javascript.info/array#declaration)

[Alert, Prompt, Confirm](https://javascript.info/alert-prompt-confirm)

[Conditionals](https://javascript.info/ifelse)

[Logical Operators](https://javascript.info/logical-operators)

[Loops - while, for](https://javascript.info/while-for)

[Functions](https://javascript.info/function-basics)


#### Eloquent Javascript - A Book

find here: [https://eloquentjavascript.net/](https://eloquentjavascript.net/)

**Description:**

This is the go to book on Javascript. It talks about kind of the "big" picture of javascript and what it is for and how best to use it.

**Suggested Use:**

A former learning track CoderGirl read it and loved it. I have personally not read it (books on programming don't hold my attention well). But if you like using books, this could be a GREAT resource for you.
