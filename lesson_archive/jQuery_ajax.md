# jQuery Ajax Lesson

### This Lesson's Focus: Learn AJAX
So in our javascript we have been using variables to store our data on the front-end. In production or on a normal website, we need to get the data from the backend. You will use something called AJAX to request the necessary json
data from the backend. Then you can use that data to fill in the content on your site.


### Course Work

#### Assignment: Learn AJAX
**Read:** To give you a little introduction to AJAX, read this nicely laid out blog post. It's a
*simple* and *quick* read to prep you for the beginning of the CodeSchool AJAX course.

**Take Course:** All you need to complete the CodeSchool project below is the *FIRST LEVEL* of this course.
But if you feel inclined to take more while you are in there... go for it!

**Do:** CodeSchool has mini projects to help you apply what you learn on the way. They use GitHub to fork and clone projects just like we do! They even have a handy way to check your project (if you keep committing and then pushing to GitHub). The instructions are pretty good... if you get stuck, reach out to a mentor!
