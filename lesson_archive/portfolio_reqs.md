# Portfolio Requirements


### Goal of the Portfolio
Selling yourself to an employer by telling them where you been, what you have learned and what you are looking for in a career. Not only telling them this but showing them as well. The site should act as a cover letter + resume + cool coding skill demo.

This will be different based on the type of job you are looking for. I know some of you are looking for a Design + Develop Job (maybe more on the design heavy side or maybe you want more of a development heavy job). Others will solely be looking for a FrontEnd Web Developer Job. Some might want to start as a FrontEnd Web Developer with opportunities to learn about the backend. My point is the following sections should be tailored to what your end goal is.


### Short Goal Paragraph
To inform people, what you have done, what you're learning and what you want to do. You can convey this in different ways, but somewhere you probably want a short paragraph outlining this. You know... the typical "elevator pitch". Don't shy away from mentioning CoderGirl and LaunchCode. They are really good publicity and people like hearing them mentioned.


### Skills List
This might change from person to person (like for those people who were in the UI/UX group or those with design skills). But for most of you it should list:

```
Terminal / Command Prompt
Git / GitHub

HTML/CSS
Javascript
jQuery (AJAX included)

React (... we will get there)
Bootstrap (if you feel like learning that)
```


### Projects

You will have multiple mini projects complete by the end of the learning track, but for them to be really good portfolio pieces you might want to clean them up a little and/or add on to them.

**LaunchCode considers the following a GOOD Portfolio Project:**

To Design & Build a Project that is "Job-Ready"...   
Projects should be unique, innovative and creative. It should demonstrate thought and planning and show you can build from scratch. It should show that you can complete high-quality work (code is organized and clean). It should demonstrate skills that you have already learned and then maybe some new ones that you picked up just for that project.

It needs:
1) Responsive HTML/CSS (optional: bootstrap)
2) Great User Interface (looks good)
3) 3-5 Javascript Features/Functionality ("wow" skills)
4) Enhancement with JS framework (we will get here)


Project Examples:


>E-commerce site: display products and enable purchase  
Feature 1: user management (registration, login, etc.)  
Feature 2: gallery of items (view and select items)  
Feature 3: shopping cart (save items for later)  
Feature 4: checkout  (purchase saved items)  
Feature 5: payment API


>Map application: access map APIs and display areas of interest  
Feature 1: map of the location (google Map API)  
Feature 2: search interface for areas of interest (Yelp API, or FourSquare)  
Feature 3: display areas of interest on map  
Feature 4: display information about location  
Feature 5: provide directions from user location?  


>Calendar application: display an interactive calendar  
Feature 1: user management (registration, login, etc.)  
Feature 2: display calendar  
Feature 3: display different calendar views  
Feature 4: display user created events  
Feature 5: save user calendars  


### Project Ideas

If you are struggling with a project idea, I can most definitely help with that. I can also advice how to clean-up or add-to our "class" project to make them portfolio worthy.


### Contact Info

It wouldn't be a bad idea to put your contact information somewhere on the site. BUT ONLY the contacts where you want employers to contact you. It could be cool to have a whole form that emails yourself :) Bonus, becaues it is a good javascript feature as well!


### Other Things

Hopefully this helps you get started. Again, let the mentors know if you are stuck or need help or just need to brain storm with them!

Here are something things to read if you want (remember take them with a grain of salt... everyone has opinions on the internet):
