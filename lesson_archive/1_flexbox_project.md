### Intro

To Practice Flexbox (and to practice Javascript later), you will be starting a new project. A couple things about this project...

1)  there is no github repo to clone or copy... you are to create the html and css file structure yourself :) Then after you create the file structure don't forget to do a git init in the project directory so you can use git!

2) the design files are just the layout of the site, but colors and styles are up to you... so go crazy (but no pressure... i am a pretty minimal designer myself. ha)!

3) change the content too! this site will use teacher, student and course information... I have pretty much copy and pasted just one so you can see how the things should layout, but you should be creative and make up some!

3) the site consists of 3 different pages (teachers, students, courses)

This project is called CG Education. It has been designed to force you to use some flexbox (so make sure you use it).

When you are done with at least the layout and minimal styling... make sure you submit your github url associated with this project :) If you need help with that please contact a mentor OR refer back to other lesson where we setup a remote repo on Github.
