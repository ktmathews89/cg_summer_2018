# Practicing HTML/CSS with Your Portfolio Project

### Intro
Let's apply what we learned from the first HTML/CSS courses...

We are going to make some more edits to your portfolio project... here is the wireframe of what your result should look like:

<img width="80%" style="display:block; margin:auto;" src="images/portfolio_design_1.png" />
<img width="80%" style="display:block; margin:auto;" src="images/portfolio_design_2.png" />
<img width="80%" style="display:block; margin:auto;" src="images/portfolio_design_3.png" />

Wireframes will give you the general layout of the page. However, they do not give you colors and too many styles. This will be up to you and your preferences. For now, we are just worried about using HTML and CSS to match this layout.

#### Challenge 1 - Nav Bar
Use your knowledge of ul and li elements to construct the navbar with your name, and 4 other elements (about, experience, skills and projects).

#### Challenge 2 - Section Headers
Add the 4 h1 elements with the titles of each section, About, Experience, Skills, and Projects.

#### Challenge 3 - About Section
Use you knowledge of the `display` css property to align your image and paragraph about yourself.

#### Challenge 4 - Experience Section
The experience section has 2 different styles of text. I'll let you decide which html elements to use for these. Code at least 2 experiences... even if they are completely made up :)

#### Challenge 5 - Skills Section
The skills section is a little different. Each skill is in a box. Create 2 divs with a text element of your choice inside. Give each div a background-color and style the text appropriately.

#### Challenge 6 - Projects Section
The Projects section is similar to the Skills section EXCEPT the outer divs will have more than just one text element inside. Create at least 2 project divs with 3 text elements inside (a project title, a project description, and a project link). Make sure to give each project div a "fixed" width and display them inline.

#### Challenge 7 - STYLE AWAY!!
So you are probably thinking... this is real ugly. You are right! but at least you got the html structure down. Time to get to styling a little bit... I am leaving that vision up to you but feel free to use colors, borders, background colors, text styles, and if you are feeling like figuring out a NEW thing... go checkout google fonts :)
