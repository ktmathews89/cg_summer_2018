# Learn AJAX Lesson

### This Lesson's Focus: Learn AJAX
So in our javascript we have been using variables to store our data on the front-end. In production or on a normal website, we need to get the data from the backend. You will use something called AJAX to request the necessary json
data from the backend. Then you can use that data to fill in the content on your site.


### Course Work

#### Learn JSON

JSON is a data structure ... kind of like the javascript array and javascript object. JSON actually stands for JavaScript Object Notation. Why do you need to know it? Well a lot of time data is passed around with JSON because a lot of different languages can understand it. A javascript array is only an array in the javascript language... arrays in other languages might be written and behave differently.

JSON is language independent! So a lot of languages can read JSON and create JSON. Making it an ideal language for your frontend to talk to a backend somewhere. The frontend might be written in one language and the backend in another.

**JSON syntax**

JSON is very similar to Javascript object literal.

Javascript Object Literal
```
{
    id: 1,
    name: Tasha,
}
```

JSON
```
{
    'id': '1',
    'name': 'Tasha'
}
```

Instead of using property names and values, everything is written as a string.

To learn more, you can do one of two things... or both if you feel so inclined...

Option 1) complete these JSON challenges in CodeAcademy:

Option 2) read about JSON and how it relates to a Javascript object

[Digital Ocean Article - JSON](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-work-with-json-in-javascript)

What did you learn? JSON is very similar to Javascript Object right?! What is different though?
