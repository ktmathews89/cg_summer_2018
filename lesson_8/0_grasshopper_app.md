# Learn Coding Concepts with the Grasshopper App

**Plan:** List steps/tasks in [Trello Boards](https://trello.com/cg_webdev_ss_2018)

**Do:** Download app to your phone and play (instructions below).

**Record:** [Lesson 8.0 - Grasshopper App](https://learn.launchcode.org/courses/131/assignments/7223)

## Intro
Grasshopper is a coding app that teaches coding _concepts_ without users actually having to write code. It is a good first introduction to a programming language for beginners. In the app, you will learn how to use tools that are found in all programming languages, like variables, conditionals, functions and loops.

This assignment is _OPTIONAL_... so if at anytime you don't think app is useful to you... feel free to move on to the next assignment.


## Goals
1. Download the app to your phone or tablet.
2. Play until completion of all levels :)
3. Record canvas assignment.


## Step 1: Download the Grasshopper App

[Grasshopper](https://grasshopper.codes/) will have to be downloaded on a phone or tablet. You should be able to find it in the Apple App Store or Android Store. Just open the store on your phone and search for "Grasshopper". If you have trouble finding it, just reach out on slack.


## Step 2: Complete all levels

Once downloaded, open the app and start playing. It should walk you through what you need to do. Keep going until you finish all levels :)
