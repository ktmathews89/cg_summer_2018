# Learning Terminal Commands

Now that we have been introduced to the terminal in class, let's learn a little more about it...


**Plan:** List steps/tasks in [Trello Boards](https://trello.com/cg_webdev_ss_2018)

**Do:** Complete requirements below.

**Record:** [Canvas Assignment - Lesson 3.1 Terminal Intro](https://learn.launchcode.org/courses/131/assignments/6948)


#### Read: Quick Article

This article is a good refresher for what we went over in class but also expands upon things a bit. It should help you understand a little more about what the terminal/command prompt can do and how you can use it.

#### Practice: Take Course

The Linux Journey is an interactive course where you learn and complete challenges along the way. It uses some high level language but does a pretty good job of explaining what things are used for. If you get confused along the way, feel free to ask question in the Slack Channel or write down to ask in next class :) You don't have to complete the whole course, but at least complete through level 13 rm (remove). It wouldn't hurt to do the whole thing though... just saying.

#### Create: Make a Cheat Sheet

Now, create a Command Line "cheat sheet" for yourself with a list of commands and a brief description of what they do and how to use them. This "cheat sheet" could be in a notebook or just on your computer. You want to make sure you will have access to it though.


#### Additional Resources

These are to use as you need... I would recommend skimming through at least. Then if you feel you need more practice or find yourself in need of a refresher later... you know where to find this resource and what it would offer.
