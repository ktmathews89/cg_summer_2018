### Intro

### Challenges

Alright, time to learn some more Javascript...

If you haven't, go ahead and complete rest of the challenges in the nodeschool.io course...

* IF STATEMENTS
* FOR LOOPS
* ARRAYS
* ARRAY FILTERING
* ACCESSING ARRAY VALUES
* LOOPING THROUGH ARRAYS
* OBJECTS
* OBJECT PROPERTIES
* FUNCTIONS
* FUNCTION ARGUMENTS
* SCOPE

If you already have, we are going to switch over to FreeCodeCamp. The NodeSchool.io course was good for a JS Intro... but FreeCodeCamp should give us a more through understanding.

Head to FreeCodeCamp and create an account if you do already have one. Then you want to navigate to the Basic Javascript Challenges by using the Map (see below).

After that you want to make sure to complete Challenges:
