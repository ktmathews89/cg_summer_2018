# CSS Selection

The first part of using css is to select an element on the page to style. We can do this with classes and ids. But there are A LOT of other way to indicate which HTML element you want to style without creating new classes or ids. By improving our css selection skills we can write better code by utilizing the things that already exist in our html to keep our code clean and minimal.

## Read About Different CSS Selectors

This article gives pretty great descriptions and examples of the different css selectors. You can read through this as throughly as you want. It will most definitely help you with the CSS Diner Game below. So up to you!

My suggestion is probably to quickly read through it (understand mostly what it is saying and learn about a couple of different selection)... then play the game below... then come back to this article.

So if you get stuck on a level in the game, you can use this article to help "unstick" you... or use google (always)!
