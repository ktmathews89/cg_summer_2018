# How The Web Works - Big Picture

Before we start getting into the details of programming... let's try to get a bigger picture of what is going when you open a web browser (like Chrome or Firefox), enter a url and the website loads on your screen.


**Plan: [Trello Boards](https://trello.com/cg_webdev_ss_2018)**

**Do: _see learning content below_**

**Record: [Canvas Assignment - Lesson 1.1 How The Web Works](https://learn.launchcode.org/courses/131/assignments/6704)**

### Do

Draw a diagram or write a paragraph describing the what happens when you type a URL into the address bar of a web browser (like Chrome or Firefox). From entering the URL to the web page loading on your computer. Make sure to include how the Internet knows where to find the files your computer needs and what files get sent to your computer for your browser to load?

We will talk about this at the MeetUp next week so no worries if you struggle. But also be prepared to share :)
